# Agent Instructions

- This project is a Pi package with a TypeScript extension entrypoint.
- Pi extensions run with full system permissions; keep side effects explicit and documented.
- Keep `extensions/index.ts` thin. Compatibility behavior belongs in focused modules under `extensions/anthropic-compat/`.

## Fork rules (take precedence over the upstream rules below)

- This fork never calls `registerProvider` for `anthropic`, so it never displaces pi-black or another provider wrapper. Replay runs in `before_provider_request`, prompt order in `context_with_system`, and summary requests go through `ctx.modelRegistry.streamSimple` so the registered provider's payload transform and fetch wrapper apply. Keep the pi-black-style wrapper test in `test/integration.test.ts` passing.
- Keep-tail is emulated with Pi's own compaction split. The upstream `tail.ts`, per-request boundary records, `keepRecentTokens` setting, live tests (`test/live.test.ts`, `test/cli.live.test.ts`) and strict-tool summary downgrade are not part of this fork; rules below about them do not apply.
- Merge upstream with `git merge upstream/main`. Take upstream's fixes and features where they fit these rules, and record each upstream change this fork does not carry in `CHANGELOG.md`.

- Native compaction must fail closed. Do not silently substitute a plain-text summary after native failure.
- Preserve exact native blocks and signatures. Never print credentials, signed block contents, or raw provider error bodies.
- Live tests report every error they meet as a test diagnostic, even when they pass: extension error and warning notices, extension errors, and failed responses. Use `test/support/error-log.ts`. Summarize failed responses by stop reason, HTTP status, and error category; never print provider error text or credentials.
- Keep final provider-payload transforms effective, including the Anthropic system-prompt patcher.
- Anthropic live tests keep normal tool, capability, extension, and resource loading enabled. Never restrict tools or disable resources to simplify the harness. Preserve the effective prompt-patcher rules in isolated test state.
- Keep-tail compaction must use verified earlier native requests and preserve the retained messages exactly. Never infer native boundaries from displayed turn counts or silently fall back to full-history compaction. The one fallback is a session whose strict tool set Anthropic rejects: compact the full history and notify the user.
- Keep request-boundary records compact. Persist hashes rather than a complete transcript copy for every request.
- Validate retained thinking with Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, and Haiku 5.5 at low effort, real signed thinking blocks, explicit error enforcement, and rejection controls. Never increase live-test effort without authorization.
- The release script must run `npm run test:live` against its exact candidate archive before signing. This runs every validated model's SDK test and the Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, and Haiku 5.5 packaged-CLI tests on the repository Pi with the pinned `pi-system-prompt-patcher` development dependency. Never depend on a globally installed Pi or patcher. Cover both full-history and retained-message compaction for Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, and Haiku 5.5. Cover compaction past Anthropic's strict tool limit on Sonnet 5.5, with and without configured retention. Cover compaction after a really interrupted tool call on Sonnet 5.5, with and without configured retention. Cover a continuation after full-history compaction whose signed block records a tool removal on Sonnet 5.5. Cover the published cancellation reason on Sonnet 5.5. Cover a session that starts with a shell command on Sonnet 5.5: a control without the extension must miss the prompt cache at a tool change and fail enforced thinking-prefix replay, the same steps with the extension must keep both, and keep-tail compaction must succeed in the SDK and packaged-CLI tests. Cover a summary request after a finished response that reads the last turn's cached prefix on Sonnet 5.5. A missing prerequisite or failed live test blocks signing and tagging. Keep the post-commit reproducibility rebuild free of duplicate live requests. SDK tests alone do not establish runtime compatibility.
- Never bind `PI_PACKAGE_DIR` for tests. `npm test` and `npm run test:live` remove an inherited value so each Pi resolves its own package directory.
- Resolve the effective prompt-patcher rules the way the patcher does (model file over provider file; relative, absolute, and `~/` references), copy them into the isolated agent directory, and point isolated settings at the copy. Copy rules unchanged; rules that name Pi's package directory use the patcher's `{piPackageDir}` placeholder. Preserve global configuration.
- Every Anthropic agent turn and summary request of a branch uses the same prompt order. Move the leading prompt ahead of earlier user messages only in a branch without a sent response or with a recorded move.
- Read prompt and tool declarations from transcript system messages, never from `getSystemPrompt()` or tool lists. Serialize retained tails behind the prompt snapshot Pi records on compaction entries.
- Background compaction remains out of scope.
- Keep `/anthropic-settings` aligned with `/codex-settings`: Enter edits drafts,
  Apply to session persists settings with the session without configuration-file writes, Ctrl+S saves
  and applies, and Escape discards only unapplied drafts. Reopening must show
  active session values, not file values. Restore session settings across reload,
  restart, and resume. Keep them scoped to the session identity, not its branches
  or process lifetime. Preserve
  changed-field persistence, inheritance, conflict detection, and the shared
  interaction tests in `test/settings-menu.test.ts`.
- Preserve unrelated concurrent filesystem changes. Ask only when they directly conflict with scoped work.
- Run complete non-writing validation through `mise run check`.
- Run `npm run pack:dry` to inspect the npm package contents before release.
- Keep `.github/npm-package-files` synchronized with every intentional package-content change; local release validation and both CI jobs enforce it exactly.
- Use Conventional Commits and maintain `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog style; add entries for `feat:` and `fix:` changes under `Unreleased`.
- Keep changelog entries under `Unreleased` for prereleases and move them into a release section only for stable releases.
- Use `npm run release -- <version>` to build the release package locally, create an SSH-signed `release: v<version>` commit containing its `Npm-Artifact-SHA256` trailer, verify a clean rebuild, and create the matching lightweight tag.
- Push the release commit and tag atomically; do not use `git tag -a`, `git tag -s`, `git tag -m`, or `cog bump --annotated`.
- Push stable or prerelease `v<version>` tags and let CI build and stage the package with trusted publishing and provenance, then create the immutable GitHub release from the verified archive and the version's changelog section. Never create GitHub releases by hand. Stable versions use `latest`; prereleases derive a non-`latest` dist-tag from their first prerelease identifier.
- Keep tests in `test/*.test.ts`, code that tests import or load into Pi in `test/support/`, and test data in `test/fixtures/`.

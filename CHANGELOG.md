# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fork

- Merge upstream 0.0.19. Require Pi `>=1.5.0 <1.6.0`.
- Carried from upstream, adapted to the fork's provider-neutral design: the `summaryInstructions`
  setting, HTTP 529 retries with announced backoff, error type and code in failure messages,
  tool definitions recorded with the checkpoint so replay can declare tools the signed block
  removes, inline tools in the saved template, the cache breakpoint on summary requests, the
  `compaction:cancelled` event, and recording the template only for the request Anthropic accepted.
- Move the prompt ahead of a shell command that precedes the first prompt in the
  `context_with_system` event instead of a provider wrapper, only while native compaction is on or
  after the branch recorded the move.
- Not carried: upstream's provider replacement (`registerProvider`), `tail.ts` keep-tail with
  request-boundary records and the `keepRecentTokens` setting, the strict-tool summary downgrade
  (the saved template already holds the tools Pi's own retry sent), and the live and packaged-CLI
  tests with their release gate.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-11-04

### Changed

- Require Pi `>=1.5.0 <1.6.0`.

## [0.0.18] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- A `summaryInstructions` configuration setting replaces the default summary guidance in every
  native summary request, including automatic compaction. Guidance from `/compact <instructions>`
  follows it. The limit of 16,000 characters now applies to the whole instruction text.

## [0.0.17] - 2026-10-25

### Fixed

- A session that starts with a `!` shell command no longer loses its prompt cache and the
  thinking of earlier responses when a tool is added or removed, for example when
  pi-compact-assistant adds `compact`. Pi puts that command ahead of the prompt, so its Anthropic
  provider sent the prompt inside the conversation and the full tool list in `tools` on every
  request. The extension now moves the prompt first, and Pi keeps `tools` fixed and defines later
  tools inline. Keep-tail compaction no longer cancels in such sessions. Sessions that already
  received a response keep their order until their next compaction.
- The native summary request no longer drops a tool added mid-conversation. It treated the tool
  as hidden because it was missing from the request's `tools`, so the summary request diverged
  from the turns at that point.
- A native summary request after a finished response, as with `/compact` between turns, now
  reads the conversation from the prompt cache. Pi set no cache breakpoint on a final response,
  so the request read only the cached tools and system prompt and billed the conversation as
  uncached input.

## [0.0.16] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Publish the reason for every cancelled native compaction on the shared `pi.events` channel
  `compaction:cancelled` as `{ source: "pi-anthropic-compat", reason }`. Pi reports only
  "Compaction cancelled", so extensions that request compaction, such as pi-compact-assistant,
  can now tell the model why.

## [0.0.15] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed

- A session no longer fails every request after compaction with "tool_addition/tool_removal
  references unknown tool" when a tool was removed before compaction. Anthropic records the
  removal in the signed summary, and the extension now declares the removed tool again so the
  summary can remove it. Sessions already compacted by 0.0.14 recover on their next request.
- Native compaction no longer fails on Anthropic's transient HTTP 529 `compaction_unavailable`
  error. It retries up to 3 times after 2, 4, and 8 seconds, or after the server's `retry-after`
  delay up to 60 seconds, as Pi does for its own compaction, and shows a warning before each
  retry.
- Compaction failure messages now name Anthropic's error type and error code, such as
  `HTTP 529 overloaded_error, compaction_unavailable`, instead of only the HTTP status.

## [0.0.14] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed

- Compaction no longer fails with "Resolve pending tool calls before native compaction" after
  you interrupt a response while it streams a tool call. Pi never sends such an interrupted or
  failed response, so its unanswered tool call no longer blocks every later compaction in the
  session.

## [0.0.13] - 2026-10-22

### Changed

- Require Pi `>=1.4.0 <1.5.0`.

## [0.0.12] - 2026-10-17

### Changed

- Require Pi `>=1.3.0 <1.4.0`.

## [0.0.11] - 2026-10-15

### Changed

- Require Pi `>=1.2.0 <1.3.0`.

### Fixed

- Full-history compaction no longer fails with "Too many strict tools" or another strict
  tool limit while Pi's turns succeed through its non-strict retry. It sends
  `strict: "prefer"` tools non-strict after such a turn and retries a rejected summary request
  once without them, as Pi does. With **Native tail tokens** set, these sessions compact the full
  history and show a warning, because retained messages cannot replay behind the changed tools.
- Record the system instructions, tools, and request boundary only for the request Anthropic
  accepted. A turn Pi retried no longer records the rejected attempt as well.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Native full-history and retained-message compaction for Claude Haiku 5.5
  through the direct Claude API. The live model capability check still applies.

### Changed

- Require Pi `>=1.1.0 <1.2.0`. Restart Pi after upgrading its runtime.
  If the last compaction kept recent messages, set Native tail tokens to `0`
  and compact the full conversation before upgrading Pi.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Require Pi 1.0.0 or newer. Restart Pi after upgrading its runtime.
  If the last compaction kept recent messages, set Native tail tokens to `0`
  and compact the full conversation before upgrading Pi. Changes to prompt text
  and tool declarations can invalidate retained history, even when thinking is off.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Declare the tools the turns sent in native compaction under Pi codemode's
  `only` mode. Summary requests rebuilt the tools from the transcript, which
  still lists the tools codemode hides from turn requests. Full-history
  summaries missed the prompt cache, and keep-tail compaction always cancelled.
- Resume sessions whose saved `/anthropic-settings` values include a setting a later
  version removed or no longer accepts. Those fields are skipped instead of failing
  the whole record at session start.

### Changed

- Require Pi 0.99.1 or newer. The extension refuses to load on an older Pi.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Native on-demand compaction and retained-message replay for
  `claude-sonnet-5-5`. Sonnet 5.5 requires Pi 0.99.1's model catalog.

### Changed

- Validate releases against Pi 0.99.1. Pi 0.87.0 and newer remain supported.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Separate menu sections with blank rows, using compact spacing on short terminals.
- Align setting names on the left and values in a stable column on the right.
  Render the search placeholder in muted gray instead of ordinary input text.
  Keep Save and Discard hints visible in narrow terminals.
- Align settings with the Codex menu: Enter changes values, Ctrl+S saves and
  applies drafts, and Escape discards unapplied drafts. Search no longer prevents
  changing settings.
- Save only changed overrides, preserve inheritance and external edits, and
  report conflicting saves without overwriting them.

### Added

- Apply to session without changing configuration files. Reopening settings shows
  active session values, including after reload, restart, or resume.
  Ctrl+S can save session-only changes later.
- Numeric editors with presets and custom values, configuration-source labels,
  inherited-value resets, and keyboard, focus, and mouse support.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Native compaction and retained-history replay for Claude Opus 5.5 on Pi 0.87.1.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Clarify Pi runtime selection and system-prompt patcher configuration in the packaged documentation.
  Native compaction and retained-history replay behavior are unchanged.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Require Pi 0.87.0 or newer and validate against Pi 0.87.0.
- Respect Pi's message omissions and replacements when selecting recent messages to retain.

### Fixed

- Preserve mid-conversation prompt and tool updates during retained-history replay on Pi 0.87.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Load under an installed Pi package by importing the Anthropic Messages adapter through the `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` entry that Pi resolves for extensions, instead of an unresolvable `api/` subpath.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Native on-demand Anthropic compaction for manual and automatic Pi compaction on Pi 0.86.0 or newer.
- Persistent signed-summary replay, full session-history retention, and compaction usage accounting.
- Searchable `/anthropic-settings` menu with session changes, explicit saves, and discard controls.
- Trusted project configuration, cancellation, and concurrent session/configuration change protection.
- Configurable native tail retention with verified request boundaries, exact thinking replay, and resume/fork support.
- Strict thinking-prefix enforcement for retained history and a live Fable 5.1 low-effort test with rejection controls.
- Live packaged-CLI test that exercises native compaction, replay, and resume through the shipped Pi executable.

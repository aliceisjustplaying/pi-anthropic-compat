# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.10] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Native full-history and retained-message compaction for Claude Haiku 5.5
  through the direct Claude API. The live model capability check still applies.

### Changed

- Require Pi `>=1.1.0 <1.2.0`. Restart Pi after upgrading its runtime.
  If the last compaction kept recent messages, set Native tail tokens to `0`
  and compact the full conversation before upgrading Pi.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Require Pi 1.0.0 or newer. Restart Pi after upgrading its runtime.
  If the last compaction kept recent messages, set Native tail tokens to `0`
  and compact the full conversation before upgrading Pi. Changes to prompt text
  and tool declarations can invalidate retained history, even when thinking is off.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Declare the tools the turns sent in native compaction under Pi codemode's
  `only` mode. Summary requests rebuilt the tools from the transcript, which
  still lists the tools codemode hides from turn requests. Full-history
  summaries missed the prompt cache, and keep-tail compaction always cancelled.
- Resume sessions whose saved `/anthropic-settings` values include a setting a later
  version removed or no longer accepts. Those fields are skipped instead of failing
  the whole record at session start.

### Changed

- Require Pi 0.99.1 or newer. The extension refuses to load on an older Pi.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Native on-demand compaction and retained-message replay for
  `claude-sonnet-5-5`. Sonnet 5.5 requires Pi 0.99.1's model catalog.

### Changed

- Validate releases against Pi 0.99.1. Pi 0.87.0 and newer remain supported.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Separate menu sections with blank rows, using compact spacing on short terminals.
- Align setting names on the left and values in a stable column on the right.
  Render the search placeholder in muted gray instead of ordinary input text.
  Keep Save and Discard hints visible in narrow terminals.
- Align settings with the Codex menu: Enter changes values, Ctrl+S saves and
  applies drafts, and Escape discards unapplied drafts. Search no longer prevents
  changing settings.
- Save only changed overrides, preserve inheritance and external edits, and
  report conflicting saves without overwriting them.

### Added

- Apply to session without changing configuration files. Reopening settings shows
  active session values, including after reload, restart, or resume.
  Ctrl+S can save session-only changes later.
- Numeric editors with presets and custom values, configuration-source labels,
  inherited-value resets, and keyboard, focus, and mouse support.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Native compaction and retained-history replay for Claude Opus 5.5 on Pi 0.87.1.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Clarify Pi runtime selection and system-prompt patcher configuration in the packaged documentation.
  Native compaction and retained-history replay behavior are unchanged.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Require Pi 0.87.0 or newer and validate against Pi 0.87.0.
- Respect Pi's message omissions and replacements when selecting recent messages to retain.

### Fixed

- Preserve mid-conversation prompt and tool updates during retained-history replay on Pi 0.87.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Load under an installed Pi package by importing the Anthropic Messages adapter through the `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` entry that Pi resolves for extensions, instead of an unresolvable `api/` subpath.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Native on-demand Anthropic compaction for manual and automatic Pi compaction on Pi 0.86.0 or newer.
- Persistent signed-summary replay, full session-history retention, and compaction usage accounting.
- Searchable `/anthropic-settings` menu with session changes, explicit saves, and discard controls.
- Trusted project configuration, cancellation, and concurrent session/configuration change protection.
- Configurable native tail retention with verified request boundaries, exact thinking replay, and resume/fork support.
- Strict thinking-prefix enforcement for retained history and a live Fable 5.1 low-effort test with rejection controls.
- Live packaged-CLI test that exercises native compaction, replay, and resume through the shipped Pi executable.
